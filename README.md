## 🚀 Features

- 📸 **Waste Reporting** — Citizens can report waste with image uploads, live GPS location, and optional voice messages.
- 🧠 **AI Waste Classification** — Integrated a TensorFlow CNN model to classify waste into Organic, Metal, or Glass and assign severity (Low/Medium/High).
- 🔐 **Authentication** — Secure Google login for users and role-based access for admins via Firebase Authentication.
- 📊 **Admin Dashboard** — Real-time dashboard to monitor complaints, reports, feedback, and assign cleanup actions.
- 💬 **Feedback & Complaints** — Supports rating, image comparisons, and escalations if issues are not resolved.
- 🌐 **Geolocation + Voice** — Captures location coordinates and allows audio input for richer reporting.
- 📈 **Analytics** — Predictive insights using historical data to help authorities optimize waste collection schedules.
